# RGB-D-SLAM

My take on a SLAM, based on shape primitive recognition with a RGB-D camera.
The system uses depth informations as a connected 2D graph to extract primitive shapes, and use them with 3D points and lines to estimate it's position in space.
A map is created with those points, lines and primitive shapes.

The primitive detection is based on [Fast Cylinder and Plane Extraction from Depth Cameras for Visua Odometry](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02380.pdf).
See the Doxygen documentation on [GitHub Pages](https://baptistehudyma.github.io/RGB-D-SLAM/html/index.html).

For now, we are at the state of visual odometry with local mapping.


## Examples
Some examples are given, but their dataset are not given.
A configuration file must be given for every example, based on the model given in **configuration_example.yaml**.
This configuration file must be placed in the **data/my_dataset** folder.

- **CAPE** : The CAPE dataset contains RGB-D (size: 640x480) sequences of low textured environments, that are challenging for point-based SLAMs. It contains planes and cylinders, initially to test the CAPE process.
The groundtrut trajectory are given for some sequences. 
- **freiburg-Berkeley** : The Freiburg-Berkeley datasets are sequences of raw RGB-D (size: 640x480), with accelerometers data and groundtruth trajectories. Their is a lot of different videos, with different conditions (translation/rotations only, dynamic environments, ...)

## packages

```

## Detailed process
### feature detection & matching
The system starts by splitting the depth image as a 2D connected graph, and run a primitive analysis on it.
This analysis extract local planar features, that are merged into bigger planes.
Using an iterative RANSAC algorithm, those planar features are fitted to cylinders if possible, providing two kind of high level features.
Those high level features are matched on one frame to another by comparing their normals and Inter-Over-Union score.

The system also extract points and lines, to improve reliability of pose extraction.
The lines are extracted using LSD.
The feature points are tracked by optical flow and matched by their BRIEF descriptors when needed, and every N frames to prevent optical flow drift.

### local map
Every features are maintained in a local map, that keep tracks of the reliable local features.
Those features parameters (positions, uncertainties, speed, ...) is updated if a map feature is matched, using an individual Kalman filter per feature (no bundle adjustment yet).

New features are maintained in a staged feature container, that behaves exactly like the local map, but as a lesser priority during the matching step.

### pose optimization
The final pose for the frame is computed using the local map to detected feature matches.
Outliers are filtered out using a simple RANSAC, and the final pose is computed using Levenberg Marquardt algorithm, with custom weighting functions.

The optimized pose is used to update the local map and motion model, in case the features are lost for a moment.

The complete systems runs in real time, between 30FPS and 60FPS for images of 640x480 pixels (depth and RGB images).

## To be implemented soon
- Advanced camera parameter model
- Point descriptors based on custom neural network
- Usage of keyframe to separate local maps
- Loop closing based on multiscale neural network 
- Use a graph between keyframe to represent the trajectory, and close the loop easily (using bundle adjustment)
- Create a new separate trajectory when loosing track of features, and merge it to the main trajectory when possible
