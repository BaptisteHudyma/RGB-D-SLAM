The program source files are organized as so\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{features}}\+: Handles the feature detection and matching.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{keypoints}}\+: detect and match keypoints, using their descriptors and short term optical flow
\item {\bfseries{lines}}\+: detect and match lines
\item {\bfseries{primitives}}\+: Handle the detection and tracking of planes and cylinders, based on a connected graph technique described in \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02380.pdf}{\texttt{ Fast Cylinder and Plane Extraction from Depth Cameras for Visua Odometry}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{map\+\_\+management}} The \char`\"{}\+Mapping\char`\"{} part of SLAM. It\textquotesingle{}s a local map implementation, with no loop closures
\item {\bfseries{outputs}} All the outputs that this program produces are stored here EXCEPT the images, that are handled by their classes (the map display is handled by the map class)
\item {\bfseries{pose\+\_\+optimization}} Contains all the pose optimization functions. The optimization process uses a Levenberg-\/\+Marquardt algorithm for frame to frame optimization
\item {\bfseries{tracking}} The tracking functions, as Kalman filters and observers motion model
\item {\bfseries{utils}} Math and cameras utils functions. Also contains the main types (eg\+: Pose)
